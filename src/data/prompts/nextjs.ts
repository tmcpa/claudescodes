This is a Next.js 14+ project using the App Router architecture.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Server Components by default

## Project Structure
- \`app/\` - App Router pages and layouts
- \`components/\` - Reusable React components
- \`lib/\` - Utility functions and shared code
- \`public/\` - Static assets

## Conventions
- Use Server Components by default, add 'use client' only when needed
- Prefer named exports for components
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow the Next.js file-based routing conventions
- Use next/image for optimized images
- Use next/link for client-side navigation

## Code Style
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Prefer async/await over .then() chains
- Use early returns for cleaner code
- Keep components small and focused

## Commands
- \`npm run dev\` - Start development server
- \`npm run build\` - Build for production
- \`npm run lint\` - Run ESLint
